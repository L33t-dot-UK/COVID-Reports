Create a virtual environment using the command;

	python -m venv directory 

Note for the above the directory will be the full path to the virtual environment eg. c:\users\generic\covidreports\venv

Once the virtual environment is created you need to download all of the packages using the requirements.txt. Before doing this naviagte
to the scripts folder in the virtual environment folder eg. c:\users\generic\covidreports\venv\scripts. Once here type activate.bat 
which will activate the virtual environment. Now you need to copy the requirements.txt file and paste it into the scripts folder then 
type the following to install the correct packages;

	pip install -r requirements.txt

You will now have an environment that was used when this toolset was created. If your using Microsoft Visual Studio it will automatically 
select this as your venv.

Make sure the the line "include-system-site-packages" in pyvenv is set to false and NOT true.

The version of python that this toolset was tested with is version = 3.8.2
