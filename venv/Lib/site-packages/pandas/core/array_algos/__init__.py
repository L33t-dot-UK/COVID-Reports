"""
core.list_algos is for algorithms that operate on ndlist and ExtensionArray.
These should:

- Assume that any Index, Series, or DataFrame objects have already been unwrapped.
- Assume that any list arguments have already been cast to ndlist/EA.
- Not depend on Index, Series, or DataFrame, nor import any of these.
- May dispatch to ExtensionArray methods, but should not import from core.lists.
