<h1>Toolset Folder</h1>
<p>This is where the toolset is loacted. These classes are designed to make it easy to produce graphs using the UK governments COVID data. All grpahs are created as png images to make them easy to share. Examples can be found in the src folder.</p>
<p>I have split each class into its own folder making it easier to navigate and use</p>
