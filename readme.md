# COVID-19 Toolset

This code allows you to download COVID-19 data from the UK Governments COVID dashboard and create graphs with the data or use it in ML/AI systems

An example is shown at the start of the chart class inn COVIDTOOLSET.py and runWebsite.py contains the code that I used to create the graphs for the website http://www.COVIDreports.uk

This is a WIP and I will add to it as time goes on.

For a list of all methods in the 4 classes from COVIDTOOLSET.py open the COVIDTOOLSET.html file which has been created using pyDoc.
